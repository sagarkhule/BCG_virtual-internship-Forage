BCG - Customer Churn
This case study was an excellent opportunity to learn the ins and outs of the strategy consulting process, from conducting market research to delivering recommendations to clients.

The case study was structured around a hypothetical client, a local telecom operator that was struggling with declining profits and increased competition. I was tasked with developing a strategy to help the company regain its competitive edge, increase profitability and learn while doing so!

The first step in the process was to conduct market research to gain a deeper understanding on handset leasing plans and their impact on profitability on the existing players in the market. For this, I went through several analyst reports & articles to get an overview on the same.

Next, I worked on data analysis and modeling to develop a financial model for the client. This involved forecasting revenue and costs for the company and determining the impact of introduction of handset leasing on top-line,profitability & ARPU.

Using the insights gained from the research and analysis, a recommendation were made for the client and finally, presented the findings and recommendations to the client in a comprehensive report, which included detailed financial projections and implementation plans.

Overall, working on this case study was an excellent opportunity to learn the process of strategy consulting from start to finish. It emphasized the importance of thorough research, data analysis, and clear communication in developing effective strategies for clients
